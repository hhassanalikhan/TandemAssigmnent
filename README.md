# TandemAssigmnent
I have used python3 for the implementation of this assigment.

Reviewer can compile the assignment using the following command

     python3 triviaApp.py Apprentice_TandemFor400_Data.json

"triviaApp.py" is the name of the code file and "Apprentice_TandemFor400_Data.json" is the name of the JSON file for the trivia data.

Please keep the JSON file and the code file in the same folder.


How to play:

1- Execute the python code file

2- Press 'Y' or 'y' when "Should we start? [Y\N]" prompt comes

3- Question will be displayed with the possible options

4- Enter the desired option number when prompted with "Your answer? (Press 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 and press enter):" and press enter.

5- You will be displayed with the right/wrong answer prompt and your current points.

6- Step 3 and onwards will be repeated for all of the questions in the JSON file.


Thank you.
